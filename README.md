# 🦆 Welcome to our Duckietown!

> _Because ducks deserve smart traffic, too._

Welcome to our **Duckietown**, a university project where we teach our robotic friends how to navigate urban traffic without causing any quacking chaos. 🚗🤖🦆

## 🐥 Who are we?

We're an enthusiastic team of students and robotics lovers committed to bringing order (and a bit of humor) to the busy streets of Duckietown. Our goal is to implement innovative solutions for autonomous navigation.

**Meet the team:**

## 🚦 What are we working on?

Our project focuses on:

- 🗺️ **Autonomous Navigation**: Implementing algorithms to help Duckiebots move autonomously and safely through the streets.
- 📷 **Computer Vision**: Enhancing the visual perception of our robots.
